## Healing on Hold: The Problem

Nurses are the backbone of clinical care, but they’re spending a large portion of their time on tasks unrelated to nursing:

- 📄 **10%** of a nurse’s shift goes to non-nursing duties like paperwork and fetching supplies.  
- 🕐 **60 minutes per shift** are lost hunting for equipment, translating to **$14 billion** in lost productivity across the U.S. annually (Vizzia Tech & GSU, 2024).
- 📉 Direct patient care accounts for just **19%** of their time, while documentation and charting consume **27%**.
- 🇨🇦 In Canada, oncology nurses spend up to **33%** of their time on non-nursing tasks, including notifying patients of appointments.

These inefficiencies are more than just workflow issues — they affect patient care, nurse mental health, and operational costs.

## Proposed Features

PORTER is designed with simplicity, utility, and safety in mind.

### 🧠 Autonomous Task Management
- Deliver basic patient care items like water, pillows, or medication.
- Retrieve supplies on command using voice-activated prompts or service buttons.
  
### 📝 Scribe Functionality
- Follows nurses and records documentation through voice transcription.
- Reduces the time spent on paperwork and charting.

### ❤️ Vital Monitoring
- Automates vitals collection such as blood pressure and minor blood tests.
- Multiple medical staff have noted that having vitals "on-hand" would be a *game changer*.
